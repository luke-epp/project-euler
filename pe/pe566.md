### Cake flips

Need a way to store continuous sections of flipped and not-flipped cake


#### F(9,10,11) = 60 ?
- somehow this cycles back or something
- maybe if we digest this we can figure out some secrets to calculating arbitrary F
360 / 9 = 40 takes 9 slices to get back to start
360 / 10 = 36 takes 10 slices to get back to start
360 / rt(11) ~= 108.5440840479949 takes root 11 slices to get back to start

### F(10,14,16) = 506 ?
360 / 10 = 36
306 / 14 = 25.714285714285715
360 / sqrt(16) = 90
on the first pass we will flip everything over

### Wants
- function that takes current flipped parts and plots them as a different color than the rest of a circle
- if I have a function that does a flip, then I get a list of flips, then I add one to every



#### Thinking
- flip two rational numbers
- flip one irrational number


### How to flip a slice
- if the start is flipped
- if the start isn't flipped
- there could be a bunch of flips in the middle
- negate eveything pretty much, if you hit a start of something flipped , then flip it 
- then have to mirror the whole thing afterward


- when you have to flip a slice, and the start is flipped
- idk, maybe it is easier to just have a continuous chunk
- if I had the whole thing to 3 decimals that would be 36,000 rows to handle, then I could vectorize it all

- let's try analytical approach, I think my numerical approach is right, it just isn't owrking right now
- there will always be a remainder, the first bit that ends up flipped is the size o
